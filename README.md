My project solution has a website about an animal farm. On the farm, there are 3 animals:
-	Bootstrap, the fearless duckling
-	CSS, the brave baby owl
-	SCSS the dangerous chicken



Aside from the index page, there is an individual page for each animal.
The duckling page uses Bootstrap 4 and its grid component to display several pictures. Additionally, it uses the Bootstrap 4 table component to display important facts about the duckling.<br><br>
The baby owl page uses CSS to display a picture of the owl, and several details in a table designed with CSS.<br><br>
The chicken website uses SCSS (variables, nesting, inheritance) to create a CSS stylesheet. This pages displays a picture, as well as a short story about the chicken.<br><br>

Aside from additional stylesheets (bootstrap/scss), all pages reference the same CSS stylesheet that uses a media query to adjust the page if it is being opened in a browser less than 600px wide. If being opened on a small screen, the page uses a vertical navigation bar and changes the background color to white. <br><br>

Thanks for grading!
