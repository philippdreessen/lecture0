My project solution has a website about an animal farm. On the farm, there are 3 animals:
-	Bootstrap, the fearless duckling
-	CSS, the brave baby owl
-	SCSS the dangerous chicken

Aside from the index page, there is an individual page for each animal.
The duckling page uses Bootstrap 4 and its grid component to display several pictures. Additionally, it uses the Bootstrap 4 table component to display important facts about the duckling.<br><br>
The baby owl page uses CSS and a media query to create a responsive website that changes based on the screen size of the person accessing the page.<br><br>
The chicken website uses SCSS (variables, nesting, inheritance) to create a CSS stylesheet. This pages displays a picture of the chicken, as well as<br><br>
